# AppLedger + ForgeTrail + xFacts specification pack

Version: 0.1.0 proposal, 2026-09-25. Owner: Catalyst Forge. Domain: AppLedger.dev, acquired by the owner. This pack defines a proposed implementation, not shipped behavior.

Implementation of the format checker has started in [Catalyst-Forge-LLC/appledger](https://github.com/Catalyst-Forge-LLC/appledger). That repository holds the canonical `spec/` and `schemas/`. This copy remains the ForgeTrail-side adoption record. Edit the format there, then refresh this pack when ForgeTrail's own migration changes.

## The move

AppLedger becomes the open, durable application record used natively by ForgeTrail. ForgeTrail replaces overlapping project tracking with AppLedger and maintains applicable xFacts records and labels throughout development. xFacts schemas retain ownership of their specialized declarations. The application owns its record independently of the agent, editor, and development method.

`schemas/` contains JSON Schemas for the manifest, record envelope, per-kind `data`, the ForgeTrail profile, and curation policy. `examples/` contains synthetic records and a policy sample. The envelope does not encode predicate pairs or whole-ledger integrity. `schemas/README.md` lists the checks a full validator still performs. `VALIDATION.md` records checks performed on this pack. `MANIFEST.sha256` inventories packaged files.

## Names and repository

| Thing | Locked value |
| --- | --- |
| Brand | AppLedger |
| Domain | AppLedger.dev |
| GitHub repository | `Catalyst-Forge-LLC/appledger` |
| npm package | unscoped `appledger` |
| CLI | `appledger` |
| Ledger directory | `appledger/` |
| Site package | private `appledger-site` |

Do not use the dashed slug `app-ledger`. In this organization, dashes mark two-word xFacts repositories such as `feature-facts`. AppLedger is one coined name, same pattern as ForgeTrail and `forgetrail`. The domain, ledger directory, and CLI already have no dash.

Availability of the GitHub repository and the npm name still has to be confirmed before creation or publication. The user creates the remote and stakes or publishes the npm name. This pack does not publish anything.

The implementation repository is a sibling of ForgeTrail. This pack is the canonical proposal until `appledger` exists. After that, `spec/` and `schemas/` in that repository are the canonical format, and ForgeTrail keeps the adoption, migration, and profile requirements.

The `appledger` package must not depend on the `forgetrail` package. ForgeTrail may depend on a pinned `appledger` release. The AppLedger repository is a ForgeTrail project, so it keeps its own `appledger/` ledger about the AppLedger product. That ledger references `spec/` and `schemas/`. It does not replace them. A ForgeTrail methodology install is not an npm dependency.

The public site is a FilePress site in `site/`, on the same pattern as forgetrail.dev. LocalSlip leases the site port. LocalHelm enrolls the repository. Neither tool is a format requirement or a library dependency of `appledger`.

## Status and precedence

MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and MAY express requirements for the proposed implementation. They do not claim external standardization or current product support. AppLedger is initially an openly published specification with a reference implementation. Public adoption is unproven. The format contract, predicate table, kind schemas, profile schema, and policy schema in this pack are normative for implementation. Semantic checks listed in `schemas/README.md` still sit outside those JSON Schemas.

Existing child xFacts schemas govern existing labels. This proposal cannot silently change their fields. Within this pack, the standard, record contract, evidence contract, and publication contract are normative. Examples illustrate them. A conflict blocks implementation of that specific detail until corrected in a recorded decision.

The requested deliverable is a specification pack. No repositories, packages, websites, or production data were modified or deployed.
